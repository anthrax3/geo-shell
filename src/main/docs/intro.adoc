=== Modules

Geo Shell has modules for dealing with *vectors*, *rasters*, *tiles*, *maps*, and *styles*.

For *vector* layers, you can use *workspace* commands access layers of spatial data
in datasets like shapefiles, geopackages, or postgis databases.  With *layer* commands
you can perform geoprocessing functions like calculating centroids or buffer features.

For *raster* layers, you can use *format* commands access individual rasters from geotifs or world images.
With *raster* commands you can perform mosaic, raster algebra, or crop functions.

The *tile* commands let you create tile layers, get tiles, and get rasters from tiles.

The *style* commands let you create styles for vector layers and raster.

The *map* commands allow you to visualize vector, raster, and tile layers.

=== Use

You can use geo-shell interactively by typing *geo-shell* at the command line.

Or you can write scripts and then execute them from the command line by typing *geo-shell --cmdfile script.txt*

Or by using the *script --file script.txt* command within a geo-shell session.
