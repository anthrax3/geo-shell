== Workspace

Workspaces hold vector layers.  A Workspace can be a GeoPackage database,
a directory of Shapefiles, or a PostGIS database.

=== Basics

You can open, close, and list Workspaces.  The eariest Workspace to open
is an in memory Workspace.

==== Open

include::commands/workspace_open_description.txt[]
include::commands/workspace_open.txt[]

include::output/workspace_basics_open_command.txt[]
include::output/workspace_basics_open_result.txt[]

You can open a Workspace with --params or connection parameters.
You can give it a name with --name flag.

==== List

include::commands/workspace_list_description.txt[]
include::commands/workspace_list.txt[]

include::output/workspace_basics_list_command.txt[]
include::output/workspace_basics_list_result.txt[]

Listing open Workspaces give you the name and the type Workspace.

==== Close

include::commands/workspace_close_description.txt[]
include::commands/workspace_close.txt[]

include::output/workspace_basics_close_command.txt[]
include::output/workspace_basics_close_result.txt[]

Once you close a Workspace by name it will no longer appear with the list command.

In this example, we will open a GeoPackage database filled with data from Natural Earth.
